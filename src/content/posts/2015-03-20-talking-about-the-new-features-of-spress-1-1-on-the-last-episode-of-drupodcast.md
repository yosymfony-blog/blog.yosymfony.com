On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to talk (in spanish) about the new features
of [Spress 1.1.0](http://spress.yosymfony.com/releases/2015/01/08/spress-turns-1-1-0/) on [Drupodcast](http://www.drupodcast.com/).
I used slides for showing the new goodies and near the end of the episode I talked
about the new upcoming features of [Spress 2.0.0](http://spress.yosymfony.com/releases/2016/01/02/spress-2-0-0-released/):

* **Data sources**.
* **Collections**. They are useful for defining new type of documents that
behave like pages or posts.
* **Paginator for any kind of content**.
* The **self-update command**.
